Use Trumbowyg for editing posts on WordPress!

== Description ==
This plugin will disable the Rich Text Editor (classic) as well as the Block
Editor (gutenberg) and enable the [Trumbowyg](https://alex-d.github.io/Trumbowyg/) editor instead.

The purpose of this project is to provide a test case for WP Media Library
support within Trumbowyg itself.

== Installation ==
Install like any normal WordPress plugin.
